# Model-Railway-Arduino-CMRI-Signals-and-Turnouts-JMRI
Arduino CMRI Signal and slow points (turnouts) control with PCA9685 Servo Drivers for Model Railways (/Railroads)
Example code for using an Arduino Mega to provide servo control for 48 servos and 32 colour lights used in signal masts.  The MEGA is connected to a computer running JMRI - tested with Windows 10 and Raspberry Pi 3B+ with a USB connection.  The servo motors move slowly without losing responsiveness to the JMRI Layout Editor Control Panel
